Model Card: Customer Reviews Topic Model (LDA)
Model Details

    Model type: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

    Purpose: Discover latent topics in customer review summaries to gain insights into common themes.

    Training data: 50,000 customer reviews from the [Your Dataset Name or Source]

    Number of topics: 5 (configurable)

    Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

Intended Use

    To analyze large collections of customer feedback or reviews

    To identify main themes or topics customers discuss (e.g., service, product quality, shipping)

    To support decision-making, product improvements, customer service enhancements

How the model works

    Text summaries are preprocessed (cleaned and vectorized using CountVectorizer)

    LDA learns probabilistic distributions of topics across documents and word distributions per topic

    Outputs include:

        Topic-word distributions (top words per topic)

        Dominant topic assignment per document

Input & Output

    Input: List of cleaned text documents (strings)

    Output:

        Trained LDA model

        Vectorizer used for text representation

        DataFrame listing top words per topic

        Topic assignment per document

Limitations

    Assumes input text is well cleaned and non-empty

    Topics may overlap or not be perfectly interpretable without domain expertise

    Model performance depends heavily on preprocessing and quality of input data

    Does not handle very short or sparse documents well

    Limited to discovering "themes" not sentiment or detailed semantics

Evaluation

    Topic coherence evaluated qualitatively by inspecting top words per topic

    User validation recommended for topic interpretability

Usage

Example usage snippet:

from src.features.vectorizer import vectorize_text
from src.models.topic_model import fit_lda_model, assign_topics

texts = [...]  # List of cleaned review summaries
dtm, vectorizer = vectorize_text(texts)
lda_model, vectorizer, topic_word_df = fit_lda_model(dtm, vectorizer, n_topics=5)
dominant_topics = assign_topics(lda_model, vectorizer, texts)

Ethical Considerations

    Model trained on customer reviews, which may contain biased language or sensitive content

    Topics generated reflect patterns in the data and should be interpreted carefully

    Not suitable for making high-stakes decisions without human oversight
